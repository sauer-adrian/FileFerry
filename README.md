# FileFerry

FileFerry is a tool designed to streamline data integration with SAP B1 HANA using the Service Layer API. With FileFerry, users can easily upload Excel files, and the data gets processed and sent directly to SAP B1 HANA.

## Features (Planned/Under Development)
- **Excel File Upload**: Upload your Excel files for data processing.
- **Integration with SAP B1 HANA**: Leverages the Service Layer API for seamless data synchronization.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with modern tools to deliver a sleek and responsive user experience.

## Tech Stack
FileFerry is powered by:
- **Nuxt 3**: For building a fast and modern front-end.
- **@nuxt/icon**: Provides icons for enhanced UI elements.
- **@nuxt/ui**: A design-first module for creating elegant user interfaces.

## How It Works
1. Upload an Excel file through the FileFerry interface.
2. The software processes the data and prepares it for upload.
3. FileFerry communicates with the SAP B1 HANA Service Layer API to upload the data.

## Status
FileFerry is currently in the early stages of development. More features and improvements are on the way!
